I think that the perpetrator was Alex Gomez. My first piece of evidence is the clues left behind. In the morning,  there were two objects left behind. The first being a splater of paint, the second being some canvas. The mural was painted on a wall, so there would not be any canvas to leave, and the mural was dry, so the paint could not be natural. The only place where the evidence would come from would be from alex, as he was in the art studio where both an be found. My second piece of evidence would be the witness account. The witness said they smelled fresh paint in the morning, so the mural was probably painted over. The only one with the skills and materials necessary would be alex, as he is an artist.
